# Node-vagrant test task

**This task wasn't completed.**

In two words:

Here should be implemented nodejs services which could run vagrant instances with some programm inside it. Service listens on some port and programms from vagrant instances will send some info for the service through http. Service also should check newly created tasks which stored inside some mongodb database and handle them in some queue which should be stored in Redise. 

The part of service, which should run vagrant instances, was not implemented. I used temporary stub for it (copypasted code logic for saving results). Other service components was completed. This test task was not finished because I got another job :smirk: so didn't want to get that awesome expirience with windows virtualization.
